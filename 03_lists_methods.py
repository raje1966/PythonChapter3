#list methods
#consider the following list:
L1= [1, 8, 7, 2, 21, 15]
# L1.sort() sorts the list
# L1.reverse() reverses the list
# L1.append(45) adds at the end of the list
# L1.insert(0, 3) inserts 3 at index 0
# L1.pop(3) will delete element at index 3 and return its value.
# L1.remove(21) will remove 21 from the list
# For more methods go to python docs to see what is new.
