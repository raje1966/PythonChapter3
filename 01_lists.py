# Python lists are containers to store a set of values of any datatypes
a = [2, 6, 14, 222, 34]
# print(a)
# Also in case of lists the index starts with 0, means if i print(a[0]), then I will get [2] as an output and in case I print(a[2]), then I will get 14 as an output.
# We can change the lists by changing the content like if i want to replace 2 with 42 then I will do this 
a[0]= 42
# print(a)
# Create lists using [] and print the lists using print()
